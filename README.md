**Building a Python GUI-Based Library Management System**  

In this project, we will develop a Library Management System with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library, SQLite3 API, and the messagebox module. This intermediate-level project offers a hands-on experience with database management in Python, allowing you to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. Let’s dive in!  

### Overview of Library Management Systems  
Library Management Systems are tools designed to handle and organize information related to the contents of a library. They manage details such as book titles, codes, authors, and availability. Additionally, these systems track issued books, the cardholder’s ID, and other relevant data. A Library Management System simplifies storing and maintaining this information efficiently.  

### About the Python Library Management System Project  
The goal of this project is to create a GUI-based Library Management System. It requires an intermediate understanding of the SQLite API and its commands, the Tkinter library, and Ttk's Treeview module, as well as a basic grasp of the messagebox module.  

### Prerequisites for the Python Library Management Project  
To build this project, the following Python libraries and modules will be utilized:  

1. **Tkinter** - For creating the graphical user interface.  
   - `messagebox`: Displays pop-ups for information, errors, or confirmation (e.g., Yes/No dialogs).  
   - `Ttk.Treeview`: Allows display of structured information in the GUI.  
   - `simpledialog`: Provides predefined dialog boxes for user input.  

2. **SQLite** - For database connection and operations.  

Since the SQLite3 library is not pre-installed in Python, you can install it using the following command:  

```bash
python -m pip install sqlite
```
